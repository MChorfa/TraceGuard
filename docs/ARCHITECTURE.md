# TraceGuard Architecture

TraceGuard is designed as a modular, scalable system for managing Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), provenance, and compliance in software supply chains. This document outlines the high-level architecture and key components of the system.

## System Components

1. **SBOM Parser**
   - Supports multiple SBOM formats (CycloneDX, SPDX, SWID)
   - Validates SBOM structure and content

2. **Provenance API**
   - Records and verifies provenance information
   - Implements SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) framework

3. **Blob Storage**
   - Stores SBOMs, artifacts, and associated metadata
   - Supports cloud-native storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage)

4. **Metadata Management**
   - Uses Apache Iceberg for efficient metadata handling
   - Manages data lifecycle and versioning

5. **Compliance Engine**
   - Generates OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language) reports
   - Integrates with OPA (Open Policy Agent) for policy enforcement

6. **Plugin System**
   - Allows integration with external tools and services
   - Includes plugins for GUAC, DojoEffect, and Chainloop

7. **Security Module**
   - Implements encryption and key management
   - Ensures data isolation in multi-tenant environments

8. **Lifecycle Manager**
   - Manages the lifecycle of SBOMs, artifacts, and associated data
   - Implements retention, archiving, and deletion policies

9. **Observability**
   - Integrates OpenTelemetry for comprehensive system monitoring
   - Provides tracing, metrics, and logging capabilities

## Deployment Architecture

TraceGuard is designed to be deployed in various environments:

1. **Cloud Deployment**
   - Utilizes Kubernetes for orchestration
   - Supports multi-region and multi-cloud deployments

2. **On-Premises Deployment**
   - Uses vCluster for tenant isolation in shared environments

3. **Off-Grid Deployment**
   - Leverages WebAssembly (Wasm) for lightweight, disconnected operation
   - Uses Porter for packaging and deployment in air-gapped environments

## Security Considerations

- Implements a zero-trust architecture
- Uses per-tenant encryption for data isolation
- Supports homomorphic encryption for secure computation over encrypted data

## Scalability and Performance

- Horizontal scaling through Kubernetes
- Efficient metadata management with Apache Iceberg
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Integration Points

- CI/CD integration through Dagger (Go SDK)
- API endpoints for external system integration
- Plugin system for extensibility

## Data Flow

1. SBOM Ingestion:
   - SBOMs are uploaded through the API
   - SBOM Parser validates and processes the data
   - Processed SBOM is stored in Blob Storage
   - Metadata is indexed using Apache Iceberg

2. Provenance Recording:
   - Provenance information is submitted through the Provenance API
   - Data is cryptographically signed using Sigstore
   - Provenance records are stored and linked to corresponding SBOMs

3. Compliance Checks:
   - OPA policies are applied to SBOMs and provenance data
   - OSCAL reports are generated based on compliance status
   - Results are stored and made available through the API

4. Lifecycle Management:
   - Lifecycle policies are applied to artifacts
   - Retention, archiving, and deletion operations are performed based on policies

5. Plugin Execution:
   - External tools are integrated through the plugin system
   - Plugin results are processed and stored alongside related artifacts

6. Observability:
   - OpenTelemetry collects metrics, traces, and logs
   - Data is sent to Prometheus for storage and analysis
   - Grafana dashboards visualize system performance and health

This architecture provides a robust foundation for secure, scalable, and compliant management of software supply chain artifacts and metadata.
